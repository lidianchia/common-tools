# Common Tools

A collection of useful mathematical calculators and tools.

## üßÆ LCM & HCF Calculator

An interactive web calculator for finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Highest Common Factor (HCF/GCD) of multiple numbers.

### Features

- **Multiple Number Support**: Calculate LCM and HCF for 2-10 numbers at once
- **Step-by-Step Solutions**: See detailed calculation steps for better understanding
- **Input Validation**: Smart error handling and input validation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient design with smooth animations

### Usage

1. Enter positive integers separated by commas (e.g., `12, 18, 24`)
2. Click "Calculate" or press Enter
3. View the results and detailed calculation steps
4. Use "Clear" to reset for new calculations

### Example

**Input**: `12, 18, 24`
- **HCF**: 6 (Highest Common Factor)
- **LCM**: 72 (Least Common Multiple)

### Live Demo

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like Grid, Flexbox, and animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive design principles

### Mathematical Algorithms

- **HCF Calculation**: Uses the Euclidean algorithm for efficiency
- **LCM Calculation**: Uses the formula `LCM(a,b) = (a√ób)/HCF(a,b)`
- **Multiple Numbers**: Applies recursive calculation for multiple inputs
